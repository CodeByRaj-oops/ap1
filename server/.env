# You need to replace the placeholder below with your actual OpenAI API key.
# 
# To get a working OpenAI API key:
# 1. Go to https://platform.openai.com and sign in or create an account
# 2. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 3. Click "Create new secret key" button
# 4. Give your key a name (e.g., "Book Summarizer")
# 5. Copy the generated key - it will look like: sk-abc123def456ghi789jkl...
# 6. Paste your real key below, replacing the entire "sk-your-valid-api-key" text
#
# If you're seeing an "invalid_api_key" error, it means you haven't 
# replaced the placeholder below with a real API key.
