# BookFinder - Book Recommendation and Summarization App

BookFinder is a full-stack web application that recommends books and provides AI-generated summaries in the style of each book's genre. Users can search for books by genre, title, or author, and get instant, genre-specific summaries generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 API.

## Features

- **Book Search**: Search for books by genre, title, or author
- **Genre-Based Recommendations**: View a collection of books categorized by genre
- **AI Summaries**: Get genre-specific AI-generated summaries of each book
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Tailwind CSS that works on all devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for generating book summaries

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- NPM or Yarn
- OpenAI API key (get one at https://openai.com)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone or download the repository

```bash
# If cloning from git
git clone <repository-url>
cd bookfinder

# If you downloaded a zip, extract and navigate to the folder
```

### 2. Install dependencies for all parts

```bash
# Install the root dependencies (includes concurrently for running both servers)
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided script to install all dependencies at once:
```bash
npm run install-all
```

### 3. Configure OpenAI API Key

```bash
# Edit the .env file in the server directory
# Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual API key
```

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Run both frontend and backend simultaneously (recommended)

From the root directory:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start both the server and client concurrently.

### Method 2: Run server and client separately

#### Start the backend server:
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run server

# OR from the server directory
cd server
npm run dev
```

#### Start the frontend:
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run client

# OR from the client directory
cd client
npm run dev
```

## Access the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## How to Use

1. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173
2. Use the search bar to search for books by genre (e.g., "horror", "comedy", "self development")
3. Click on any book to view its details and generate an AI summary
4. The summary will be tailored to match the style of the book's genre

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/books` - Get all books
- `GET /api/books/search?q=search_term` - Search books by genre, title, or author
- `GET /api/books/:id` - Get a specific book by ID
- `POST /api/summarize` - Generate a book summary (requires title and genre in request body)

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Script Errors
If you see errors like "Missing script: dev" or "Missing script: start", make sure you are in the correct directory:
- Root scripts (`npm start`, `npm run client`, `npm run server`) should be run from the project root
- Server-specific scripts (`npm run dev`) should be run from the server directory
- Client-specific scripts (`npm run dev`) should be run from the client directory

### OpenAI API Connection Issues
If you see errors related to the OpenAI API:
1. Check that you've added your API key correctly in the `server/.env` file
2. Ensure your API key is active and has sufficient credits
3. Check your internet connection

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
Make sure both servers are running and check that:
1. Backend is running on port 5000
2. The Vite proxy is configured correctly in `client/vite.config.js`
